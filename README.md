# CRM-2
Spec for modpack loading

See `pack.json` for modpack format and `dir.md` for directory structure in the respective revision.
There's a `schema.json` (JSON schema) for the respective spec's json file in each revision's directory.

## Example
A modpack using all of CRM-2 (revision-1) is here: https://crmm-cdn.global.ssl.fastly.net/cdn/data/cosmic-fixes/version/1.0.1/cosmic-fixes-1.0.1-crm-2.zip
